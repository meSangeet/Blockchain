What is Blockchain ?

Blockchain is a distributed immutable ledger. which is completely transparent.

Like a transaction entry book of a shop which contains all the transaction of customers, the web 3 contains a block 
which will contain all the transaction  but the difference is that this transaction cannot be removed from this block.
(This property is called immutable).

Every transaction done in a blockchain is reflected to all the systems(computers). This property is called transparent. 

All these transactions are crypt using a secret code this hide this transaction from all the other users which maintains privacy of your transactions.

Application of blockchain


1. Product Tracking

Product tracking is the means by which we can track products i.e  we can get all the information about the product for eg - where it originated, the path from which it went through so that we can be protected from buying fake products.  


2. Smart Contract

Smart contracts are simply programs stored on a blockchain that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediaryâ€™s involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow.


3. Internation Wire Transfer

When we need to transfer money from one bank to some international bank than the sender bank sends money to an intermediate correspondent bank and then the money is finally sent to the receiver bank. This whole process is centralised, expensive and time taken. Blockchain makes this process a lot easier and the fees is also very low.

Let's say a person got sick and is admitted to a hospital and he is treated for sometime in a hospital in city A. and now he is to be transferred to a city B now the new hospital will have to take all the tests or it will have to go through the centralised database of the prevoius hospital to check the tests which is again very timetaking.  Rather we can just save all the data in a decentralised database from the start.

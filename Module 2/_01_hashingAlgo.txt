Hashing Algorithm

Every block in a blockchain contains some data, hash and previous hash.

Every block is alloted a hash which is like the fingerprint of the block. This hash is generated using SHA 256 algorithm.


The hash generated using this algorithm contains 64 hexadecimal characters. Each character is of 4 bits.
So in total it has 64*4 = 256 bits.

Every block points its previous block using its previous hash. The first block of a chain do not points to any block and is called genesis block.




Five requirements of a hash algorithm - 

1. It is one way, it means you cannot get back the original data from the created hash.

2. It is deterministic. Same data will always generate same hash code.

3. Fast Computation

4. Withstand Collisions -> Very difficult to hack by any hacker.

5. Avalanche effect -> The hash algorithms gets completely changed just by a minor change in the original data.
